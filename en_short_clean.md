# \#Irefuse - (Clean and short) Guide  to get new Belgian EID

### START

In anything you do be POLITE and SUBMISSIVE. Don't get mad or fired up to the bureaucrats (M/X/F), they're a victim of the system just as much as you and just do their job.

0) Hide your old ID card somewhere in your house. I don't know wether it's a strict requirement but they ask your phone number in case something goes wrong with the procedure.

1) Take some alternate form of identification with you. E.g. a drivers license, passport, ...

2) Go get some funds at the very least you will need 25EUR but to be sure take some more. I recommend nicely anonymous cash.

3) First go get your facial picture taken in a photoboot that's compatible with the requirements found below.
Requirements here: https://diplomatie.belgium.be/en/services/services_abroad/belgian_passport/applying_passport/belgian_citizen_belgium/quality
Follow the requirement instructions for the photo carefully or they will make you take a new one!

4) Go to the town hall offices where you live. Take a ticket for the office that handles "Lost ID CARD". ***DO NOT SAY YOUR ID GOT STOLEN.***

5) Wait patiently (this can take a while).

6) If you get called to the office handling your lost ID, explain to the bureaucrat that you lost your old ID card. (NEVER SAY IT WAS STOLEN OR THEY WILL MAKE YOU GO TO THE POLICE FIRST.) ***They might give you a warning that if you lose your ID a third time they will open a case with the police for suspicious activity (I'm not sure if this scare has legal grounds.)*** Just comply with their requests and it will be fine (...I hope). They will possibly also ask your phone number.

7) Give them your alternative identification and picture.

8) The bureaucrat will do some processing, scan or take your picture and verify your alternative identification.

***IF THEY ASK YOUR FINGERPRINT AND IT'S NOT YET APRIL 2019 THEY MIGHT BE DOING SOMETHING ILLEGAL. PLEASE CONTACT ME ASAP.***

9) The bureaucrat will ask you for your signature. Give it to them.

10) Pay the privacy tax of 20EUR.

11) The bureaucrat (M/X/F) will give back your alternative identification and a temporary identification document. Do not lose this document because you will need it to receive your new ID card.

12) Wait until you get a letter notice to go get your new ID card. (Couple days or weeks).

13) Go back with your temporary identification document and get your brand new, fingerprint absent, ID card. Enter your PUK and PIN to activate your brand new card. 

14) Congratz, you now have an id card that's valid for 10 years and have 10 years time to fight this absurd privacy violating measure.
Please share and inform anyone you know to do the same BEFORE APRIL 2019.
