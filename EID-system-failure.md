A friend told me that he was currently unable to get a new EID card due to the EID system failing. I'm wondering wheter it's more broad than that. Did they get too many requests? Is it deliberate shutdown? If you have more information please contact me on this email adres: someblokewithinternet@tutanota.com

Below is a list with an overview of the municipalities where I've heard of the EID system fail since the last two weeks:
