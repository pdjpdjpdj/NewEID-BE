Several sources told me that they were currently unable to get a new EID card due to the EID system not failing. Did they get too many requests? Is it deliberate shutdown? I'm wondering this as well. If you have more information please contact me on this email adres: someblokewithinternet@tutanota.com

Below is a list with an overview of the municipalities where I've heard of the EID system fail since the last two weeks:
